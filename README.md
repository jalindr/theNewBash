# theNewBash

**theNewBash** the cocks and bulls of my bash

(And a shameless ripoff of Bash-it)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

## Install

1. Check a clone of this repo: `git clone https://github.com/revans/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it`
2. Run `~/.bash_it/install.sh` (it automatically backs up your `~/.bash_profile`)
3. Edit your `~/.bash_profile` file in order to customize bash-it.
